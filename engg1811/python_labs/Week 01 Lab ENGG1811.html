    <h2>ENGG1811 Lab 01: Introduction to the CSE computer environment, Spyder
      and Python</h2>
    <h3>Objectives</h3>
    <p>In this first lab you will get familiar with "Spyder", 
       an open source cross-platform integrated
      development environment (IDE) for scientific programming in the Python
      language. You will also learn how to use arithmetic operators in Python. </p>
    <p>There are no marks for this lab. </p>
<p>We suggest that you install the software "Anaconda for Python 3.7" on
 your laptop. Instructions for installing this software can be found at 
the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~en1811/resources/getting-started/index.html">"Getting Started"</a> link on the course website.</p>

    <h3>Demo by Tutor: Spyder and Python arithmetic operators&nbsp; </h3>
    Your tutor will introduce "Spyder" and discuss the important features
    relevant to the course. Spyder is an open source cross-platform integrated
    development environment (IDE) for scientific programming in the Python
    language.
    <p> Your tutor will <b>demonstrate</b> and explain how to use the Python
      arithmetic operators ( + - * / // % **) to do some calculations. Please
      pay special attention to <b><i>the rules of precedence</i></b>. You
      should read the following notes on this topic: <a href="https://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~en1811/21T1/labs/lab01/RulesOfPrecedence.pdf">The
        Rules of Precedence</a>. If you have any questions, feel free to ask
      your tutor! </p>
    <p> Now, get ready to solve the following exercise! </p>
    <hr size="1">
    <h3>Exercise 1: Using the iPython console and precedence </h3>
    <p>In this exercise you will use the Python arithmetic operators, which are
      + - * / // % **, to do some calculations. If you cannot remember what they
      mean, you can consult the notes on <a href="https://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~en1811/21T1/labs/lab01/RulesOfPrecedence.pdf">The
        Rules of Precedence</a>. In this exercise, you want you to use <b>as
        few parentheses</b> as possible in the Python arithmetic expressions.
      For example, you will get the same answer by using these two Python
      expressions: 1 + 2 * 3 and 1 + (2 * 3) but the parentheses in the second
      expression are unnecessary. In order to determine whether parentheses are
      necessary, you will need to apply the rules of precedence. </p>
    <p>The first calculation that you want to do is to compute:</p>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="Week%2001%20Lab%20ENGG1811_files/cal1.png" alt=""></div>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p><b>Type</b> a Python expression into the console that can compute this
      quantity. You should <b>verify</b> that the Python expression gives the
      correct value. <b>Determine</b> if you have used any unnecessary
      parentheses in your expression; if there are, we ask you to remove them.
      We want you to use <b>as few parentheses</b> as possible in your
      expression. This is to test whether you understand the concept of
      precedence. </p>
    <p>The second calculation is: </p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="Week%2001%20Lab%20ENGG1811_files/cal2.png" alt=""> </p>
    You should use <b>as few parentheses</b> as possible in your Python
    expression. <br>
    <p>Note that the expressions that you type into the console will be saved in
      a log. If you click on the "History log" tab (see picture below), you will
      see the expressions that you have entered into the console. When you want
      to show the tutor your work, you can copy the expression from the log and
      paste it into the console. If you want to get back to the console, you
      should click the "iPython console" tab. </p>

    <h3>Exercise 2: Using the iPython console for calculations </h3>
    <p>Our default concept on birthday is that it is annual. If you go to the
      website <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/date/birthday.html" target="_blank">https://www.timeanddate.com/date/birthday.html</a>
      on alternative birthday calculator, you can calculate when your 1 billion
      second birthday, 1 million minute birthday etc. will be. Quantities such
      as 1 billion seconds are hard to comprehend for most of us. However, if we
      tell you 1 billion seconds is approximately 31 years and 259 days
      (assuming each year has 365 days, i.e. ignoring leap years) then you
      probably feel a bit more comfortable. A comforting news for most of you is
      that you haven't missed your 1 billion second birthday and there is plenty
      of time to plan a big bash for that auspicious second!&nbsp; </p>
    <p>We are interested to express 1,000,000 (1 million) minutes in terms of
      years, days, hours and minutes. For this exercise, we would like you to
      work out the number of complete years and complete days in 1 million
      minutes. We impose the following assumptions and restrictions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>One year has 365 days, one day has 24 hours and one hour has 60
        minutes. We ignore leap years. </li>
      <li>There are two answers to the exercise: the number of complete years
        and days. You must compute each answer using only one line of Python
        code in the iPython console. The line of code can only contain the
        numbers 1000000, 365, 24 and 60; no other numbers are allowed. </li>
      <li>You can use any Python arithmetic operators + - * / // % ** that you
        think is appropriate. In particular, you will find // and % helpful. If
        you cannot remember what they do, you can look at page 14 of the lecture
        slides. Sometimes it may be helpful to type in a few small test
        expressions to confirm your understanding. For example, you type in 20
        // 7 and obtain the output 2, then you think about whether the output is
        what you would expect and why. </li>
      <li>You may also use parentheses. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you want to check whether your calculated number of years and days are
      correct, you can check the answers <a href="https://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~en1811/21T1/labs/lab01/lab01_answers.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

    <h3>At the End of the Lab</h3>
    <p></p>
    <p>You should be able to show your tutor the above exercises. You should be
